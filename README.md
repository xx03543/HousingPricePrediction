# Housing Price Prediction 

Problem Statement:
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics 
to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, 
the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. To build a regression model using regularisation in order to 
predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

Essentially, the company wants to know â€”

Which variables are significant in predicting the the price of a house.
How well those variables describe the the price of a house.
Business Goal
To model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how 
exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high 
returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
